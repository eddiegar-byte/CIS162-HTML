<p>Hello, my name is Eduardo Garcia, a student at Cerritos College studying computer and 
   information science(CIS). I have been attending Cerritos College for a few years, 
   taking courses in various subjects and gradually working my way to an associate's 
   degree. Most classes I've attended have been online in both asynchronous and remote 
   formats. I also work part-time as a newspaper courier, bagging and delivering newspaper 
   to clients. Admittedly, I'm not the most sociable or approachable individual around; it's 
   something I need to improve a good deal upon.</p>

<h2>What I like to do in my free time:</h2>
<ol>
   <li>I very much enjoy (actively) listening and humming to music.</li>
   <li>I like to play video games.</li>
   <li>Reading, mainly online: articles, wikis, ebooks.</li>
</ol>

<p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p>
