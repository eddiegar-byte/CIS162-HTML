      Hello, my name is Eduardo Garcia, a student at Cerritos College studying computer and 
      information science(CIS). I have been attending Cerritos College for a few years, 
      taking courses in various subjects and gradually working my way to an associate's 
      degree. Most classes I've attended have been online in both asynchronous and remote 
      formats. I also work part-time as a newspaper courier, bagging and delivering newspaper 
      to clients. Admittedly, I'm not the most sociable or approachable individual around; it's 
      something I need to improve a good deal upon.

   <h2>What I like to do in my free time:</h2>
   <ol>
      <li>I very much enjoy (actively) listening and humming to music.</li>
      <li>I like to play video games.</li>
      <li>Reading, mainly online: articles, wikis, ebooks.</li>
   </ol>

      My favorite website is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
